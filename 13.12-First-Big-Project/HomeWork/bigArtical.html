            Abu Dhabi GP: Lewis Hamilton claimed F1 title-deciding race was
            'manipulated' in radio message
          </h2>
        </div>
        <div class="paragrath">
          <p>
            Lewis Hamilton said "this has been manipulated" in a radio message
            to his Mercedes team after the controversial ending to the Abu Dhabi
            GP. <br />
            In a message aired via car on-board channels, Hamilton suggested to
            race engineer Peter Bonnington with four corners of the race to go:
            "This has been manipulated, man." <br />
            Hamilton lost the title after being overtaken on the race's final
            lap by Max Verstappen after a Safety Car triggered a sequence of
            events that incensed Mercedes. <br />
            Mercedes were angered by Race Control's handling of the restart
            procedure after only the five lapped cars between Hamilton and
            Verstappen were able to overtake and the race restarted at the end
            of that same lap. <br />Stewards heard their case but dismissed it,
            saying FIA race director Michael Masi had acted within the
            regulations. But Mercedes have lodged an intention to appeal the
            decision and have until Thursday evening to formalise any challenge.
            <br />
            Mercedes continue to assess their options. <br />
            The only post-race interview Hamilton concluded was his immediate
            one in parc ferme, in which he sportingly congratulated Verstappen
            on his title victory. <br />
            "Firstly, congratulations to Max and to his team," Hamilton told Sky
            F1's Jenson Button.
